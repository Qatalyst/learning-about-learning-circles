# Group Prompts

If youâ€™re in a group, there is an opportunity to further interrogate this activity to help refine your learning circle program: 
- How might learning circles address some of the barriers that you added in the prior activity?
- How do you currently understand and document the needs, interests, and experiences of the various communities you serve? 
- What audiences or communities do you aim to serve through learning circles, and what might benefit or interest them most?
- What do you want to learn? How can your own personal and professional interests remain present in this program?
