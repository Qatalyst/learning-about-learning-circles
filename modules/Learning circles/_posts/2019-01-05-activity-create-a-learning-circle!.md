# Activity: Create a learning circle!

We have developed a series of open source software tools to help you facilitate a learning circle. You can think of it like a free and simple event management page that is connected to a global community of other people who are doing the same thing. Even if you aren’t sure when or what you want to facilitate, creating a draft learning circle is the best way to understand what this process entails. 

You can create a learning circle for free at anytime [using the P2PU website.](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/create/ ) Go ahead! Try it out now! Or, if you like, keep reading below for more details.

Once you create a learning circle, we’ll automatically spin up a website for you to promote your learning circle.

You can manage your learning circle details at anytime using the [P2PU Dashboard](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/organize/). Remember! You’ll need to create a P2PU account first to make a learning circle live.

Here’s some other great things that you can do with the Dashboard:
- See who has signed up and be able to communicate directly with them.
- Automatically send a reminder message to participants each week via email or SMS. 
- Give feedback on a weekly basis that will be shared with your learners, your colleagues (if you’d like), and P2PU.

The dashboard also creates a unique learning circle survey for both facilitators and learners that automatically compiles into a final report (shown above and [viewable here](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/923/report/)). Two days after the last meeting of a learning circle, the report will be sent to the facilitator, any team organizers, and all the registered participants by email.

You can save a learning circle as a draft or publish it right away. Your learning circle will appear on our [worldwide list of learning circles.](https://www.p2pu.org/en/learning-circles/)

Once you create a learning circle, you’ll receive an email point you to [promotional and outreach materials](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/promotion-and-outreach), as well [as a checklist](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/creating-a-learning-circle) to ensure that you have all your supplies ready.

If your learning circle is part of a team, then you can view your learning circle alongside all of your colleagues learning circles at your team link. As an example, check out [http://p2pu.org/knls](http://p2pu.org/knls).
