# What does it look like?

Learning circles usually meet for 90 minutes/week for 6-8 weeks with between 4-15 participants, though this model is flexible. With less than four people, you don’t have much expertise and support to draw from. With more than 15 people, it can be difficult to manage and host a conversation. 

Learning circles follow a method: check in, coursework, group activity, and plus/delta.

# Check-in
A good first meeting usually starts with check-in, goal setting, and expectations for the group involvement (homework/no homework?). Saying right at the beginning, too, that learning circles are different than a class and that everyone is here together to support each other, sets a good tone for the rest of the learning circle meetings.

# Coursework
The majority of each learning circle is devoted to working through the online course. Depending on the course and week, course work can be run individually, in small groups, or as a large group gathered around a single computer or projector. 

We’ll discuss **group activities** and **plus/delta** later in this course.

At the end of a learning circle, learners and facilitators receive an online survey which ask everyone what worked well, what could be improved (both the course and the learning circle) and what their next steps will be. This report is made public for other facilitators and learners to see.

Sometimes, learning circles finish by receiving [certificate of completion](https://community.p2pu.org/t/certificate-template/2784). Others have even hosted big graduation ceremonies music and cake!  Other times too, a simple discussion about what people learned and what their next steps are is all that is needed. Many times learners even want to keep meeting! In the end, it’s up to you and your learning circle to decide how to end.
