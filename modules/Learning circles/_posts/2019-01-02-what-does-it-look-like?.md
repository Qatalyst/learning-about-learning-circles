# What does it look like?

![Here is a picture of a group of kenya librarians sitting in circle using computers](https://community.p2pu.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0d3b35c5d48545f248a42ab44dba4357bc081a0b.jpeg)

Learning circles follow a method: check in, coursework, group activity, and plus/delta.

## Check-in
A good first meeting usually starts with check-in, goal setting, and expectations for the group involvement (homework/no homework?). Saying right at the beginning, too, that learning circles are different than a class and that everyone is here together to support each other, sets a good tone for the rest of the learning circle meetings.

## Coursework
The majority of each learning circle is devoted to working through the online course. Depending on the course and week, course work can be run individually, in small groups, or as a large group gathered around a single computer or projector. 

## Activity
Sometimes group activities emerge naturally from the online course, but if you’re looking for a more intentional approach, we have created some group activities which you can use to support peer learning and bridge the gap between the online course and real life. 

## Plus/Delta
To close each week, everybody shared one thing that went that day (“plus”) and one thing to change for the next week (“delta”).
