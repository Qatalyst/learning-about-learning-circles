At the end of a learning circle, learners and facilitators receive an online survey which ask everyone what worked well, what could be improved (both the course and the learning circle) and what their next steps will be. This report is made public for other facilitators and learners to see.

Sometimes, learning circles finish by receiving [certificate of completion](https://community.p2pu.org/t/certificate-template/2784). Others have even hosted big graduation ceremonies music and cake!  Other times too, a simple discussion about what people learned and what their next steps are is all that is needed. Many times learners even want to keep meeting! In the end, itâ€™s up to you and your learning circle to decide how to end.
