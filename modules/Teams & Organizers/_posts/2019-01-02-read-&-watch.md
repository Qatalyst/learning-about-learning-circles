# Read & Watch

*Suggested timing: 30 minutes* 
## Review current teams
Teams offer a way to coordinate and support a group of learning circles that are happening in the same city or across a single institution. Each team has an organizer (or two), and this person is charged with leading the learning circle initiative in their region and coordinating with P2PU. The best way to familiarize yourself with teams is to see what‚Äôs already happening. So, to start, take a few minutes to look through the active P2PU teams at [p2pu.org/teams](http://p2pu.org/teams) and try to answer these questions for yourself:
- What team is closest to you?
- Which teams are particularly active right now?
- Is there any information missing from team pages that you‚Äôd like to include on yours?
- Are there any teams that you‚Äôd like to reach out to for guidance as you get started?

## Juliana‚Äôs organizer guide
Similar to the [facilitate page](http://p2pu.org/facilitate), P2PU has a webpage for that highlights resources for organizers: [https://www.p2pu.org/en/organize/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/organize/). Here you‚Äôll find resources that you can use to build a team of learning circle facilitators in your area.

Notably, this page is where you can download a copy of <a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/get-organizer-guide/" target="_blank">Juliana‚Äôs Organizer Guide</a>, a 25 page document that we put together with Juliana Muchai, P2PU‚Äôs very first organizer, and her team at the Kenya National Library Service. This guide introduces the six steps to starting a team:
1. Orient yourself to P2PU
1. Gather a team
1. Host a facilitator training workshop
1. Support your facilitators
1. Grow your program
1. Participate in the global P2PU community


<a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/get-organizer-guide/" target="_blank">Download your copy of the guide</a>, and spend 15-20 minutes reviewing what‚Äôs there.
## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up a team
Creating a team will all grant you access to new features on your learning circle facilitator dashboard. This includes:
- **A dedicated landing page (and memorable URL) for your team.**  This allows you to promote all learning circles across your team with a single URL. (For example, check out [https://sppl.p2pu.org/](https://sppl.p2pu.org/) and [https://berlin.p2pu.org/](https://berlin.p2pu.org/)). 
- **Team features on your dashboard.** Facilitators will be able to see what‚Äôs happening across their team from their dashboard.
- **Weekly updates from your team of facilitators.**  These updates include the number of learner sign-ups from each learning circle, a weekly team schedule as well as a summary of facilitator feedback. All facilitators can opt in to receiving this weekly email from their dashboard.
- **Aggregated feedback.** Data from learning circles in your team can be aggregated and shared for evaluation and reporting purposes.
