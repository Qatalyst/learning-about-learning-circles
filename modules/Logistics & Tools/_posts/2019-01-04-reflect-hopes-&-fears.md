# Reflect: Hopes & fears

*Suggested timing: 10 minutes* 

Now that you’ve made a plan to get your first learning circle off the ground, let’s reflect a bit on how we hope it will be and what we’re worried about. This is a reflection exercise called Hopes and Fears. 

Using post-it notes (or small pieces of paper), take some time as individuals to write down some hopes and fears (or worries) that you have about facilitating your first learning circle. Write just one hope or fear per piece of paper.

After everyone is done, combine your notes as a group, creating a hopes grouping and a fears grouping. Take a few minutes to cluster them into common themes and then discuss. Are there hopes or fears that are shared among the group? How can the group support each other through the rest of this course? How might the P2PU community support you?
