# Check-in: Space is the Place

*Suggested timing: 10 minutes*

Chances are that you can’t make major changes to the space that you are meeting in for your learning circle. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make a few small changes that will improve the experience for yourself and your peers.

Individually, read our post on the community forum about [setting up a room for learning circles](https://community.p2pu.org/t/how-to-choose-a-good-location-for-learning-circles/2758).  Then, jot down a few notes about what you like about the space you’re currently in and what can be improved.

Once everybody is finished, discuss your thoughts as a group and see if you can come up with at least one thing to change before your next meeting.
