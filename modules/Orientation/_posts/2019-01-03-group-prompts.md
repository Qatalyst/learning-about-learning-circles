# Group Prompts

If youâ€™re in a group, here are some additional questions you may want to discuss. These are designed to ensure that everybody understands the context for the workshop, that any prior expertise is named and celebrated, and that all the logistics are taken care of.
- What led you to decide to host this learning circle training workshop?
- How do you think that P2PU works to support the vision of your organization/community?
- Has anyone in your group already facilitated a learning circle? If so, briefly, what was their experience like?
