# Activity: 5-Minute Facilitation

Why talk about facilitation, when we can just practice. This activity is designed to help get you comfortable facilitating, practicing what you know. Weâ€™ve pulled together a handful of 5-minute long Youtube videos about a variety of topics. These will serve as our mini-learning circles!

- Divide into small groups of 4-10, and nominate somebody to be the facilitator. Ideally this is someone who may feel uneasy in the facilitator role.
- As a group, watch one of the videos.
- When the video is finished, the facilitator gets to try their hand at facilitating a short discussion with their group. Here are some examples of discussion prompts for the volunteer facilitator.
   - What did you think about the video? What did you like about the video? What did you find useful?
   - What other practices are important to consider?
   - Does anyone have a related example, issue or challenge to share?
   - How might this impact our own work?
   - How might we evaluate or promote this work?
   - Where can be go to learn more about this issue?
- At the end, ask the group how that experience was for them as facilitators and participants, and what facilitation strategies they noticed.
- Continue the discussion on facilitation best practices, watch a new video, or change roles as you like.
