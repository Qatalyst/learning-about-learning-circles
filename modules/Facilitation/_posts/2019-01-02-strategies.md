# Strategies

As a learning circle facilitator, your job is not to teach, but instead to guide, build community, help each learner achieve their goals. It certainly is helpful to be excited or passionate about the learning circle topic, however expertise is not required 

Good facilitation requires a lot of different tasks:
- Listening to learners
- Asking clarifying statements
- Providing good feedback
- Keeping discussions on task
- Probing assumptions and evidence
- Eliciting viewpoints and perspectives
- Mediating conflicts
- Summarizing and presenting findings

That’s a lot, but don’t worry, nobody is expecting you to be perfect from day one, and it will become much easier with practice.

Below you’ll find a number of tips from some star facilitators.
