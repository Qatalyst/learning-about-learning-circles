# Group Activities

Learning circles follow a method: check in, coursework, group activities, and plus/delta. 

P2PU community have developed a number of group activities designed to complement learning circles. Each activity can take between 15-20 minutes, and are designed to foster community, build learner confidence, and help to bridge the course content and real life. 

If you’re using this course in a group setting, you’ve have already tried a few group activities out:
- Check-in
- Goal setting
- Ice Breakers
- Small group discussion

You can also think about other ways to encourage dialogue:
- Critique and feedback of each others work
- Showing final work to each other or to the public
- Problem-solving common issues
- Celebrating final week together or “Graduation”
- Field trips
- Hosting a local speaker
