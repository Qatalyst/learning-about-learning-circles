# Group Prompts

Now that you’re familiar with the learning circle model and you know how to create one, it’s worth discussing your role as a facilitator. 

A good starting place is by getting a sense of what you mean by facilitation and hearing from others who have facilitated learning experiences in the past.
- Based on what you know already, describe the difference between teaching and facilitation? 
- Does anyone have experience facilitating small groups that they want to share?
