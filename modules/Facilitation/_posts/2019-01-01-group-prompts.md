# Group Prompts

Now that you’re familiar with the learning circle model and you know how to create one, it’s worth discussing your role as a facilitator. A good starting place is to get a sense of what we mean by facilitation and hearing from others who have facilitated learning experiences in the past.
- Based on what you know already, how would you describe the difference between a class and a learning circle? What about a teacher and a facilitator? 
- Does anyone have experience facilitating small groups that they want to share?
