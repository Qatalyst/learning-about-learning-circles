# Check-in

*Suggested timing: 10 minutes* 

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what is expected from you as a facilitator.
- Feel comfortable trying this out in the real world.
- Reflect on this learning circle experience.
- Explore the opportunities for support provided by the P2PU community.

## What did you learn recently?
What is something you learned recently? Go around the group and share briefly -- remember it doesn’t have to be academic! For example, maybe you learned a new cooking technique or you finally saw [that arrow hidden in the FedEx logo](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1095/6418/files/fedex-hidden-arrow_large.png?v=1511198527).

As a group, discuss the role that teachers, facilitators, and experts played (or didn’t play) in helping you learn these things.
