# Activity: 5-Minute Facilitation

Create a mock learning circle for some of to practice your facilitation skills. 

- Choose someone to volunteer as a facilitator to to host and guide a discussion. Ideally ask someone who may feel uneasy in the facilitator role or could use some practice. 
- Watch one one of the videos below or list of videos to watch one of the videos together:
   - How do I know what people want to learn? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCnrq1iisf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCnrq1iisf8)
   - How do I run a meeting? [https://youtu.be/e3a0KbM5p9A](https://youtu.be/e3a0KbM5p9A) 
- Here are some examples of discussion prompts for the volunteer facilitator. These can be projected on the wall, printed, or have the facilitator write them out if needed.
   - What did you think about the video? What did you like about the video? What did you find useful?
   - What other practices are important to consider?
   - Does anyone have a related example, issue or challenge to share?
   - How might this impact our own work?
   - How might we evaluate or promote this work?
   - Where can be go to learn more about this issue?
- At the end, ask the group how that experience was for them as facilitators and participants.
- Ask the group what facilitation strategies they noticed?
- Continue the discussion on facilitation best practices, watch a new video, or change roles as you like.
