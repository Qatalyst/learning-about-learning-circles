# Group Prompts

Nearing the end of your time, itâ€™s up to you how to move forward and answer any final questions. It might be more helpful to answer as many questions you have all together or in small groups, or, you might want to plan how you will support each other in the near future.
- Do we want to form small groups to talk about specific issues or audiences that we will work with?
- How do we want to support each other moving forward?
