# P2PU Community


We’d like to invite you to contribute to Peer 2 Peer University, or as we say, P2PU. Truly! We believe that only way we’ll succeed if we have people like you take part, try things out, tinker around, and fail a bit, and create something useful with us that people around you value.  

P2PU started and continue to be as a community of peers helping peers learn together. And as our new peers, we invite you to join to join us to create an equitable, empowering, and liberating alternative to mainstream higher education. 

Outside of running learning circles there are many ways to contribute to our vision.
