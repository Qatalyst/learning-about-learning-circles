# Reflect: Plus/Delta

*Suggested timing: 10 minutes*

For this reflection activity, each member of the group will share one Plus and one Delta for the meeting. A plus is something that went well today, while a delta is something that you’d like to change for next time. After everyone has gone, take a few minutes to discuss if there are any ways that you can address the deltas for the next meeting.

> Plus/Delta is a reflection activity that we really love to use in learning circles. It’s a great exercise because it underscores the fact that the group is in charge of making this experience work for them. When you’re facilitating your learning circle, Plus/Delta is a great way to wrap up each week. We’ll also be covering some other reflection activities that we love later in this course :)
