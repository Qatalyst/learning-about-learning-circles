# Activity: Choose a course

As you get ready to choose a course, we’ve reached the point where you will need a P2PU account. Learners who sign up for learning circles do not need to have a P2PU account, but as a facilitator you’ll need one in order to create a learning circle and add new courses to our database.

With a P2PU account you can also post on our [community forum](https://community.p2pu.org/) and receive monthly community digests, which feature recent learning circle news from our global community as well as invitations to upcoming community calls and events.

Go ahead! [Create a P2PU account](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/accounts/register/?next=/en/login_redirect/) when you’re ready. 

After that, move onto the activity:
- Using what you’ve learned about finding courses, spend a little time looking for an online course that you think might suit your needs.
- If you find a good course that isn’t already on the P2PU courses page, [add it yourself](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/) so that other facilitators can easily find it in the future. 
- If you can’t find anything you like, [propose a topic](https://community.p2pu.org/t/what-topics-are-missing/2786) that you would like to see as course, and we’ll try to help you find one.
