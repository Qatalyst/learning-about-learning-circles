# Group Prompts

If you’re in a group, we find it helpful to take some time to share what we liked and didn’t like about the courses we found. Here are some prompting questions:
- What did you like about the course you selected?
- What was confusing? 
- Did you have any trouble accessing the course materials?
- Based on your personal experience, are there any course providers or platforms that you would recommend?
- Could you identify whether courses you found were OER?
- Are there resources that your organization already pays for that you want to make use of?
