# Activity: Create a learning circle!

We have developed a series of open source software tools to help you facilitate a learning circle. You can think of it like a free and simple event management page that is connected to a global community of other people who are doing the same thing. Even if you aren’t sure when or what you want to facilitate, creating a draft learning circle is the best way to understand what this process entails. 

You can create a learning circle for free at anytime here: [https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/create/](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/studygroup/create/) 

Once you create a learning circle, we’ll automatically spin up a website for you to promote your learning circle. You can manage your learning circle details at anytime using the P2PU Dashboard.

Here’s some other great things that you can do with the Dashboard:
- See who has signed up and be able to communicate directly with them.
- Automatically send a reminder message to participants each week via email or SMS. 
- Give feedback on a weekly basis that will be shared with your learners, your colleagues (if you’d like), and P2PU.
- Create a unique learning circle survey for both facilitators and learners as well that automatically compiles into a final report. 

You can save a learning circle as a draft or publish it right away. 

Your learning circle will appear on our worldwide list of learning circles which you can see here:
[https://www.p2pu.org/en/learning-circles/](https://www.p2pu.org/en/learning-circles/)

Once you create a learning circle, you’ll receive an email point you to [promotional and outreach materials](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/promotion-and-outreach), as well [as a checklist](https://community.p2pu.org/c/learning-circles/creating-a-learning-circle) to ensure that you have all your supplies ready.

If your learning circle is part of a team, then you can view your learning circle alongside all of your colleagues learning circles at your team link. As an example, check out [http://p2pu.org/knls](http://p2pu.org/knls).
