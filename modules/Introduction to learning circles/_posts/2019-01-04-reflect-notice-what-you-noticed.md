# Reflect: Notice what you noticed

*Suggested timing: 15 minutes*

In this module, you familiarized yourself with learning circles, explored the P2PU website, and connected with the P2PU community on our forum. This also may have been your first time participating in a learning circle! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ As we mentioned above, reflection is an important part of learning. Thatâ€™s why we suggest that every learning circle meeting take some time at the end to wrap-up with a reflection activity. So now itâ€™s your chance to do so! 

Individually, take 5 minutes to reflect on the questions below. We recommend jotting down some notes for yourself as you do so. Then take the remaining time to discuss as a group.
- How do you feel after this first module? What did you notice? What questions do you still have?
- How is this format different or similar from other learning experiences that youâ€™ve been a part of?

There will also likely be some practical issues to address as you wrap up. Some questions that often arise in the first week include:
- Do we want to stay in touch somehow during the week?
- Should we assign ourselves homework?
- Should we continue to let new people join our group?
- Do we want to go through the course separately on our own computers, use a projector, or a combination of both?

> After each learning circle, the facilitator can log into their dashboard and choose to send a wrap-up message to the group and, separately, to P2PU. This is a good way to remind the group what you spoke about before the next meeting, and to let us know if you have any questions or concerns. If youâ€™re running this course as a learning circle, we recommend that the facilitator go ahead and send out one of these wrap-up messages, so the group can get a sense of what theyâ€™re like!
