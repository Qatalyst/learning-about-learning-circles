# Group Prompts

If youâ€™re in a group, there is an opportunity to plot a path forward and ensure that any final questions are resolved. A few ways to do this are:
- Forming small groups around particular topic areas (such as different subjects that people are interested in facilitating).
- Share any outstanding questions, trying to answer as many as you can as a group, and posting any outstanding questions to the [P2PU forum](https://community.p2pu.org/).
- Work through the [team planning worksheet](https://community.p2pu.org/t/team-planning-worksheet-for-your-p2pu-community/2783 ) to plot out next steps for your team.
