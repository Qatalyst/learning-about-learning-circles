# Group Prompts

Nearing the end of your time together, itâ€™s up to you how to move forward to resolve any any final questions. 

- It might be helpful to answer as many questions you have all together or in small groups. Do you want to form small groups to talk about specific issues or audiences that you will work with?
- You might want to plan how you will support each other in the near future moving forward. Here is a [team planning worksheet](https://community.p2pu.org/t/team-planning-worksheet-for-your-p2pu-community/2783 ) that you can use to help you plan as a team. 
- You might have some final questions that are still unclear. Ask each other these questions together and [post what remains to the community forum](https://community.p2pu.org/) so that we can speak with you about it.
